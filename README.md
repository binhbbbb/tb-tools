# tb-tools - helpers for integration testing Vaadin apps

A helper that automatically generates somewhat sane identifiers for components to help integration testing using real or simulated browsers. This includes tools like Vaadin TestBench, plain WebDriver, Gatling and JMeter.

A simple use case can be seen in the projects tests, but you can also check out these example projects:

 * [tb-page-object](https://github.com/mstahv/tb-page-object/) - an example how to utilize Page Object pattern cleanly with this helper and Vaadin TestBench
 * [tb-drone-exampe](https://github.com/mstahv/vaadinized-tomee-jee6-app-stub/tree/arquillian-tb-tests) - an example that combines two cool WedDriver/Selenium extensions: Arquillian Drone and Vaadin TestBench
